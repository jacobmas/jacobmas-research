\section{Preliminaries}
We write $[d]$  to denote the set of positive integers $\{1,
\ldots, d\}$. For an integer $q\geq 2$, we use $\Z_q$ to denote the
ring of integers modulo $q$, and sometimes to explicitly represent the
integers in $(-q/2,q/2]$. We define $\abs{x} \in \Z_q$ by taking the
absolute value of the representative in this range. We use $\otimes$ to denote the Kronecker product of two matrices. To analyze our distribution in Section~\ref{sec:redtrapgrowth}, we
make use of the notion of \emph{subgaussian} random variables. 

\subsection{Signatures}
\label{sec:signatures}
We briefly recall the standard definitions of digital signature schemes.
A \emph{signature scheme} $\sig$ is a triple
$(\siggen,\sigsign,\sigver)$ of PPT (probabilistic polynomial time)
algorithms. Existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message
attack, or eu-acma, is as follows: the adversary The challenger
generates keys $(vk,sk) \gets \siggen$ and sends $vk$ to $\Adv$. At
this point, $\Adv$ can adaptively requests signatures on messages
$\mu$, and the challenger responds with $\sigma=\sigsign(sk,\mu)$, for
each message.Finally,
  $\Adv$ outputs an attempted forged signature $(\mu^*, \sigma^*)$. In
  order to satisfy eu-acma security, the probability that $\mu^* \neq
  \mu_i$ for any $i \in [Q]$ and that
  $\sigver(vk,\mu^*,\sigma^*)=1$ accepts should be negligible in the
  security parameter $\lambda$. 

\subsection{Chameleon Hashing}
\label{sec:chameleon-hashing}


Chameleon hash functions, invented by Krawczyk and Rabin~\cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/KrawczykR00}, have been applied to signature
schemes for a number of purposes, notably for generic transformations
from statically-secure signatures (where the challenger receives the
messages to be signed before giving the adversary the verification
key) to adaptively-secure signatures (where the security game proceeds
as above). As our usage of chameleon hash functions is slightly
non-standard, we briefly recall their definitions, following the
variant definition of Ducas
and Micciancio specialized to their lattice-based
construction~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/DucasM14}. 

\begin{definition}A chameleon hash function family is a set of three algorithms
  $\ch=(\chgen,\chhash,\chinv)$ along with an efficiently computable
  input distribution $\calX_n$, $\calY_n$ for each integer $n$, where
  $\bot \notin \calY_n$. Except with negligible probability over the
  choice of $(ek,td) \gets \chgen(1^n)$, the following should hold for
  security.
\begin{description}
\item[Uniformity:] For a fixed message $\mu$, evaluation key $ek$,
  trapdoor $td$, 
  $(x \gets \calX_{n}, y \gets \chhash_{ek}(\mu,x))$ should be
  distributed within negligible statistical distance of $(x \gets
  \chinv_{td}(\mu,y), y \gets \calY_{n})$
\item[Collision Resistance:] Given only access to $ek$ and public
  parameters, it should be hard for any PPT algorithm $\calA$ to
  output $(\mu,r) \neq (\mu',r')$ such that
  $\chhash_{ek}(\mu,r)=\chhash_{ek}(\mu',r') \neq \bot$. 
\end{description}
\end{definition}


Ducas and
Micciancio~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/DucasM14} provide a
ring-based construction that is more efficient in both
space and time than our main construction.
We note that this construction
has a very straightforward adaptation to general lattices and module
lattices~\cite{DBLP:journals/dcc/LangloisS15}.

\subsection{Rings and Lattices}
\label{subsec:gaussians_lattices}

The main result of the paper in Section~\ref{sec:func-eval}
abstracts out much of the concrete lattice details in the form of Puncturable
Homomorphic Trapdoor Functions (PHTDFs); see
Section~\ref{sec:punct-homom-trapd} below. However, as our paper's
primary goal is to exploit the use of the ring setting, we do need to
recall some very basic facts from algebraic number theory, which can be
found in any basic text, e.g.~\cite{milneANT}. 

\paragraph{Cyclotomic Fields and Rings.} The $m$th cyclotomic number
field $K=\Q(\zeta_m)$ for $\zeta_m$ a primitive $m$th root of unity
has as its ring of integers $R=\Z[\zeta_m] \equiv \Z[X]/\Phi_{m}(X)$,
where $\Phi_{m}(X)$ is the $m$th cyclotomic polynomial of degree $n=\varphi(m)$. For
$m=2^{\ell}, \ell\geq 1$, we have that $\Phi_{m}(X) = X^{n}+1$. This
ring $R$ has the power basis $\{1,\zeta_m, \ldots, \zeta_{m}^{n-1}\}$ as a
$\Z$-basis, and for $n \leq j < m$, $\zeta_{m}^j = -\zeta_{m}^{j-n}$
and so all $m$th roots of unity can be represented in terms of the power basis by a vector
of Euclidean norm 1. We will sometimes refer to $\zeta_m$ as just
$\zeta$ when the context is clear.

\paragraph{Gadget Matrix.} For our
complementary result on reducing the trapdoor growth for signature schemes
(Section~\ref{sec:redtrapgrowth}), we also need to recall the definition
of the gadget matrix $\matG$ defined by Micciancio and
Peikert~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/MicciancioP12}. We define $\vecg^{t}=[1,2,2^2,\ldots,2^{k-1}] \in \Z_q^{1 \times k}
\subseteq R_q^{1 \times k}$,
and then for general lattices we have that $\matG = \matI_{n}
\otimes \vecg^{t} \in \Zq^{n \times nk}$.

\paragraph{The SIS problem.} For $\beta > 0$, the \emph{short integer
  solution} problem $\sis_{n,q,\beta}$ is an average-case version of the
approximate shortest vector problem on $\lamperp(\matA)$. Given a
uniformly random matrix $\matA \in \Z_q^{n \times m}$ for any
$m=\poly(n)$, the problem is to find a nonzero vector $\vecz \in \Z^m$
such that $\matA\vecz=\veczero \bmod{q}$ and $\length{\vecz} \leq
\beta$. For $q \geq \beta\sqrt{n}\omega(\sqrt{\log{n}})$, it has been
shown that solving this problem with non-negligible success
probability over the random choice of $\matA$ is at least as hard as
probabilistically approximating the classic Shortest Independent Vectors
Problem (SIVP) on $n$-dimensional lattices to within
$\tilde{O}(\beta\sqrt{n})$ factors in the \emph{worst
  case}.~\cite{ajtai04:_gener_hard_instan_lattic_probl,DBLP:journals/siamcomp/MicciancioR07,DBLP:conf/stoc/GentryPV08}. Analogous
worst-case reductions exist for the more general case of module lattices, where
$\matA \in R_q^{d \times m}$ for some arbitrary ring of integers $R$
of an
algebraic number field $K$~\cite{DBLP:journals/dcc/LangloisS15}, which
essentially includes the above results as well as the ring-SIS problem~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/PeikertR06,DBLP:conf/icalp/LyubashevskyM06}
as special cases.
\subsection{Subgaussian Random Variables}
\label{sec:subgauss}

To analyze our distribution in Section~\ref{sec:redtrapgrowth}, we
make use of the notion of \emph{subgaussian} random variables.  (For
further details and full proofs,
see~\cite{vershynin12:_compr_sensin_theor_applic}.)  A random
vector~$\vecx$ is subgaussian with parameter~$r > 0$ if for all $t \in \R$
and all (fixed) real unit vectors $\vecu$, its (scaled)
moment-generating function satisfies
$\E\bracks{\exp(\inner{\vecu,\vecx})} \leq \exp(C r^{2} t^{2})$ for an
absolute constant $C$ (for our application, we may take $C=1$).  By a Markov
argument, for all $t \geq 0$, we have
$\Pr\bracks{\length{\vecx} \geq t} \leq 2 \exp(- t^{2}/r^{2})$.

 Any
$B$-bounded centered random vector~$\vecx$ (i.e., $\E[\vecx]=\veczero$ and $\abs{X}
\leq B$ always) is subgaussian with parameter $B$.

We recall the following additional properties of subgaussian vectors
$\vecx$~\cite{vershynin12:_compr_sensin_theor_applic}.
\begin{description}
\item[Homogeneity:] If $\vecx$ is subgaussian with
parameter~$r$, then $c\vecx$ is subgaussian with parameter $c \cdot r$ for
any constant $c \geq 0$.
\item[Pythagorean
  additivity:] if~$\vecx_{1}$ is subgaussian with parameter~$r_{1}$,
and~$\vecx_{2}$ is subgaussian with parameter~$r_{2}$ conditioned on
\emph{any} value of~$\vecx_{1}$ (in particular, if $\vecx_2$ is
subgaussian with parameter~$r_2$ and independent of $\vecx_{1}$), then $\vecx_{1} + \vecx_{2}$ is subgaussian with parameter
$\sqrt{r_{1}^{2} + r_{2}^{2}}$.
\item[Euclidean Norm]: 
  Let $\vecx \in \R^{n}$ be a random vector with independent
  coordinates that are subgaussian with parameter~$r$.  Then for some
  (small)   universal constant $0 < C$, we have $\Pr[\length{\vecx}_{2} > C
  \cdot r\sqrt{n}] \leq 2^{-\Omega(n)}$
\end{description}

\subsection{Weak Pseudorandom Functions and Learning with Rounding}
\label{sec:weak-pseud-funct}
Formally, a weak pseudorandom
function (PRF) family~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/DamgardN02} (outputting a single bit)
$\weakprf: \bit^{\lambda} \times \bit^{m} \to \bit$ is considered
secure if no probabilistic polynomial-time adversary can distinguish a
member of the family $f_{\veck}:\bit^{m} \to \bit, f_{\veck}:=\weakprf(\veck,\cdot)$ (where $\veck
\gets \bit^{\lambda}$ uniformly at random) 
from a truly random function with advantage greater than
$\negl(\lambda)$, given that it can observe
$(x_1, f_{\veck}(x_1)), \ldots, (x_m, f_{\veck}(x_m))$, for any $m \in \poly(\lambda)$,
where each $x_1, \ldots, x_m$ is sampled uniformly at random from
$\bit^{m}$. 

A concrete candidate weak PRF family is the learning with
rounding function family
($\lwr_{n,Q,p}$)~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/BanerjeePR12}.
Functions in the family are indexed by a secret key $\vecs \in
\Z_Q^n$. For a given secret key $\vecs$, the function  is defined as 
$\lwr_{n,Q,p}(\veca)=\round{\tfrac{p}{Q}\inner{\veca,\vecs}}$, where $\round{\cdot}$ denotes rounding to the nearest integer. 

$\lwr$ has been shown to be a weak pseudorandom function under the
better-known $\lwe$ assumption with discrete Gaussian noise terms (and hence on worst-case shortest
vector problems on lattices) in a number of different results~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/BanerjeePR12,DBLP:conf/crypto/AlwenKPW13,cryptoeprint:2016:589,DBLP:conf/tcc/BogdanovGMRR16,DBLP:conf/asiacrypt/BaiLLSS15}. While
all of these results require the ratio $Q/p$ to grow with the number
of samples revealed (meaning that hardness for non-a-priori bounded
$m=\poly(\lambda)$ requires assuming the shortest vector problem is hard
to approximate to within a superpolynomial ratio), there is a
reduction~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/BogdanovGMRR16} with a sample loss ratio of $Q/p$ in
security from $\lwe$ with bounded uniform error to $\lwr$. This latter result
strongly suggests that $\lwr$ remains a weak pseudorandom function
for any $Q/p=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, and that the weaker reductions from
$\lwe$ with Gaussian error are likely all artifacts of the proof
techniques used rather than inherent in the deterministic form of the
error. 

\subsection{Puncturable Homomorphic Trapdoor Functions}
\label{sec:punct-homom-trapd}
We recall Alperin-Sheriff's definition of Puncturable Homomorphic
Trapdoor Functions (PHTDFs). 

\begin{description}
\item[$pk \gets \tdfgen(1^{\lambda})$] takes
  as input a security parameter $\lambda$, which for a concrete
  instantiation implictly defines parameters for a ring $\calT$ representing a tag space, a trapdoor space
  $\calR$, a tagged function space $\calA$, an index space $\calX$, an
  input space $\calU$ and an output space $\calV$, and then generates
  the public key for the PHTDF.  
$\calR$ and $\calU$ are associated with
  parameterized efficiently sampleable distributions
  $D_{\calR,\beta}, D_{\calU,s}$, with the distribution details
  depending on the instantiation. 
\item[$(a,r) \gets \gentrap(pk,t)$] generates a \emph{trapdoor} $r \gets
  D_{\calR}$ for the $(pk,a)$, with $t$ the tag \emph{associated
  with} $a,r$. We need the
  distribution of $a$ to be statistically close to uniform over
  $\calA$. 
\item[$t \gets \tdftag(pk,a,r)$] is an auxiliary function which
  outputs the tag $t$ associated with $a$ and $r$ is a trapdoor
  for $(pk,a)$. 
\item[$f_{pk,a,x} : \calU \to \calV$] is a deterministic 
function indexed by $pk,x \in \calX,a \in \calA$. 
\item[$\tdfinv_{r,pk,a,x,s} : \calV \to \calU$] is a trapdoor-inverter
  indexed by $x \in \calX$, $r \in \calR$ and $pk,a \in \calA$. If
  $f_{pk,a,x}$ is not injective, then $\tdfinv$ is a probabilistic
  function, and the parameter $s \in \R$ relates to the noise level $\tdfprop(u)$ of
  the inverse $u$ output by $\tdfinv$; in particular, we want
  $\tdfprop(u) \leq s$. We require that $\tdfprop(r)=\beta$ should be small
  enough to allow $\tdfinv$ to invert with parameter $s$ when the tag
  $t$ associated with $a,r$ is \emph{invertible} over the ring
  $\calT$. If $t$ is not invertible, then the trapdoor is considered
  \emph{punctured}, and $\tdfinv$ outputs $\bot$.
\item[$r^* \gets
  \evaltd(g,\{(a_i,r_i)\}_{i \in [\kappa]},\vecy),
  a^* \gets \evalfunc(g,\{a_i\}_{i \in [\kappa]},\vecy)$] are
  deterministic trapdoor/function homomorphic evaluation algorithms, respectively.
  The algorithms take as input some function $g: \calT^{\kappa} \times
  \calT^{w} \to
  \calT$, a vector $\vecy \in \calT^{w}$, as well as functions $a_i
  \in \calA$ with associated trapdoors $r_i \in \calR$. The outputs are $r^* \in \calR$ and
  $a^* \in \calA$.

Let $\vect \in \calT^{\kappa}$ be a vector
such that $t_i$ is the tag associated with $a_i,r_i$. We refer to $g$ as
  \emph{admissible} with parameter $s$ on $\vect$ if for any $v
  \in \calV,\vecy \in \calT^{w}$ such that $g(\vect,\vecy)$ is invertible,
$\tdfinv_{r^*,pk,a^*,x,s}(v)$ successfully outputs $u$ such that with
overwhelming probability, $\tdfprop(u) \leq s$.
\end{description} 

\paragraph{Security Properties.} 

The following should hold for $pk \gets \tdfgen(1^\lambda)$,
trapdoor and function pair $(r,a)$ with an invertible tag $t$:
\[(pk,r,a,x,u,v) \statind (pk,r,a,x,u',v')\] where $x \in \calX$ is arbitrary, $u \gets
D_{\calU,s}$, $v := f_{pk,a,x}(u)$, $v' \gets \calV$ and $u' \gets
\tdfinv_{r,pk,a,x,s}(v')$.


The security game between an adversary $\Adv$ and a challenger $\calC$
is parameterized by a security parameter $\lambda$, as well as a
function $g: \calT^{\kappa} \times \calT^{w} \to \calT$ such that $g$
is admissible with some parameter $s$ on some subset of vectors of tags
$\calS \subseteq \calT^{\kappa}$
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1pt]

\item $\calC$ runs $pk \gets \tdfgen(1^{\lambda})$ and then
  computes $(a_i, r_i) \gets \gentrap(pk,\vect)$ for each $i \in
  [\kappa]$.  $\Adv$ is given $pk$ and $\{a_i\}$.
\item $\Adv$ may make (a polynomial number of) inversion queries, sending some $v \in
  \calV$, $x \in \calX$ and some $\vecy \in \calT^{w}$ such that
  $g(\vecs,\vecy)$ is \emph{invertible}. $\calC$ computes
  $r' \gets \evaltd(g,\{(a_i,r_i)\},\vecy)$ as well as $a' \gets
  \evalfunc(g,\{a_i\},\vecy)$, samples $u \gets \tdfinv_{r',pk,a',x,s}(v)$ and returns
$u$ to $\Adv$. 
\item $\Adv(1^\lambda)$ outputs tag sets $\vecy^{(1)}, \vecy^{(2)} \in \calT^{w}$ which satisfy\\
  $g(\vect,\vecy)=g(\vect,\vecy')=0$, as well as
  $u^{(1)},u^{(2)}, x^{(1)}) \neq x^{(2)}$, and wins if
  \[f_{pk,a^{(1)},x^{(1)}}(u^{(1)})=f_{pk,a^{(2)},x^{(2)}}(u^{(2)}),\] where
  $\tdfprop(u^{(1)}),\tdfprop(u^{(2)}), \tdfprop(x^{(1)}),\tdfprop(x^{(2)})  \leq s$ and $a^{(b)} \gets
  \evalfunc(g,\{(a_i)\}, \vecy^{(b)})$ for $b \in \{1,2\}$.
\end{enumerate}

We say the PHTDF satisfies
$(\epsilon=\epsilon(\lambda),t=t(\lambda),g,\calS)$-collision
resistance when punctured (CRP) security if every PPT adversary taking
at most time $t$ has success probability at most $\epsilon$ in this
game.

\paragraph{Concrete Instantiation.}
\label{ref:concrete_inst}
The instantiation in~\cite{DBLP:conf/pkc/Alperin-Sheriff15} is written
in terms of general lattices, but as mentioned in that work, can
easily be instantiated over rings or
modules~\cite{DBLP:journals/dcc/LangloisS15}. 
In our work, we will be instantiating the construction over $R_q$,
where $R=\calO_{m}$ is the $m$th cyclotomic ring and $q=3^{k}$ for
some $k$, as in the signature scheme of Ducas and
Micciancio~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/DucasM14}. 

\begin{theorem}[~\cite{DBLP:conf/pkc/Alperin-Sheriff15}]\label{thm:phtdf}
Let $g$ be admissible with parameter $s$. 
If there exists  $\Adv$ breaking
$CRP_{\epsilon,t,g,\calS}$ security of the PHTDF, then there exists
$\Adv'$ running in time $t$ that solves $\sis_{n,q,\beta}$ with
advantage $\epsilon-\negl(\lambda)$ for $\beta=O(s^2\sqrt{n
  \log{q}})$. 
\end{theorem}

We recall the growth rate of the $\tdfprop(r)$ for
the trapdoors used in this instantiation as a result of homomorphic
operations.  For our concrete instantiation, we let $\tdfprop(r^*)$ output the
minimum $\beta$ such that $r^*$ is subgaussian with parameter
$\beta/(\sqrt{m})$. When $r^*$ is viewed as a matrix, this
means that with overwhelming probability, $r^*$s largest singular
value is at most $\beta$~\cite{vershynin12:_compr_sensin_theor_applic}.

In particular, we have 
\begin{description}
\item[Homomorphic addition] of $a_1$
and $a_2$ with trapdoors $r_1, r_2$ induces a new trapdoor $r^*$ with 
$\tdfprop(r^*)=\tdfprop(r_1)+\tdfprop(r_2)$ 
\item[Homomorphic Multiplication] of $a_1, a_2$ with trapdoor $r_1,
  r_2$, tags $t_1,t_2$ induces trapdoor $r^*$ with 
$\tdfprop(r^*)=\tdfprop(r_1)\matG^{-1}(a_2)+\tdfprop(t_1)\tdfprop(r_2)$. Finally,
homomorphic
multiplication of $a_1$ with trapdoor $r_1$, tag $t_1$
by a constant tag $t_2$, induces a trapdoor $r^*$ with 
$\tdfprop(r^*)=\tdfprop(r_1)\matG^{-1}(t_2\matG)$, and the growth is independent of the values or size of $t_1$ and
$t_2$. 
\end{description}
A key trick is to chain homomorphic
multiplications together
in a left-associative manner, causing quasi-additive growth in the
trapdoors~\cite{DBLP:conf/innovations/BrakerskiV14,DBLP:conf/crypto/Alperin-SheriffP14}.



For the concrete ring setting we use, we recall the following result about the trapdoor growth from
this technique, adapted
from~\cite[Corollary 3.6]{DBLP:conf/crypto/Alperin-SheriffP14} and using techniques from
Section~\ref{sec:redtrapgrowth}.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:asym-growth} Let $R_q$ be as above.
Let $t_i=\zeta_m^{\ell_{i}}$ (where $\ell_{i}$ is a non-negative integer), $i \in [d]$ be tags associated with
functions $a_i$ and trapdoors $r_i$, where $\zeta_m$ is
a primitive $m$th root of unity, and let $n=\varphi(m)$.  
Let $a^*, r^*$ be the result of homomorphically multiplying together
these functions and trapdoors in a left-associative manner. Then 
$\tdfprop(r^*) <=2\sqrt{d}\sqrt{n}\max(\tdfprop(r_i))$.
