\subsection{Supplemental Proof of Security }
\label{sec:suppl-proof-secur}

For completeness, we include the proof of security for
Theorem~\ref{theoremsmall} for Scheme 2. 

\begin{proof}
Let $\calF$ be an adversary mounting an eu-scma attack against Scheme
2 and succeeding with probability $\delta$ such that $g$ meets the
conditions given in the theorem statement. Then by these conditions, given the $Q$ message hashes
$(x^{(j)} = h(\mu^{(j)}) \in \calX)$ from the adversary and $Q$ tag
vectors $T^{(j)} \gets D_{T^{\ell}}$ sampled, with probability
$\epsilon_1$ we can find in
polynomial time a $\hat{T}$ such that $g(\hat{T},T^{(j)})$ is
invertible for all $j$. Otherwise, with probability $(1-\epsilon_1)$
we abort. 

If we do not abort, then we invoke the $(\epsilon^*, t=\poly(\lambda),
g, (\hat{T},\hat{T}'))$-CRP security game, receiving back $pk$ and
$\veca$. We then choose some $\bar{T} \in \calT^{\ell}$ such that
$g(\hat{T},\bar{T})=0$ and sample some $\bar{x}$ from the set of elements in
$\calX$ not in the range of the hash function $h$. We then compute
$\bar{a} = \evalfunc(g,\veca,\bar{T})$, sample $\bar{u} \gets
D_{\calU}$ and set $v \gets f_{pk,\bar{a},\bar{x}}(\bar{u})$. By the
distributional equivalence of inversion property of the PHTDF, this is
statistically indistinguishable from having chosen $v \gets \calV$. 

We then provide the public key $(pk,\veca,v)$ to the adversary. To
compute signatures for each hashed messages $x^{(j)}$, we make an
inversion query to the CRP oracle on $v, x^{(j)}, T^{(j)}$, receiving
back $u_j$ and outputting $\sigma_j=(u_j,T_j)$ as the signature. By
the properties of the PHTDF, this is indistinguishable from the real
eu-scma attack game. 

Now, with probability $\epsilon_2$ the tag $T^*$ used by the adversary
in a successful forgery $(\sigma^*=(u^*,T^*))$ on a (hashed) message
$x^*=h(\mu^*)$ will be such that $g(\hat{T}, T^*)=0$. Then letting
$a^*=\evalfunc(g,\veca,T^*)$, we have that 
\[f_{pk,a^*,x^*}(u^*) = f_{pk,\bar{a},\bar{x}}(\bar{u})=v,\]
where $x^* \neq \bar{x}$ and  $\tdfprop(u^*), \tdfprop(\bar{u}) \leq
s$, and as a result, we have broken the $(\epsilon^*, t=\poly(\lambda), g, (\hat{T},\hat{T}'))$-CRP
security of the underlying PHTDF with probability $\epsilon^* =
(\delta - (1-\epsilon_1))\epsilon_2$.
