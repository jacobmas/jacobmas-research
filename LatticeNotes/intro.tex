\section{Introduction}

To prove or find a proof of somehow: 

Let $\Phi(p)$ be the $p$th cyclotomic field for a prime $p$, $f \in
\Phi(p)$ be a balanced ternary polynomial. Then $\text{N}(f)=p^t\cdot
\prod_{q\text{ prime}, q^{t_q}=1 \bmod{p}}(q^{t_q\cdot e_q})$ where
$t,t_q\geq 1$, $e_q\geq 0$ 


(Pretty sure this is true dunno how it could help though but it might?)
